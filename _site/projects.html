        <p>TARTANHACKS REGISTRATION SYSTEM</p>
        <p>This is the registration system for TartanHacks, Carnegie Mellon's largest hackathon. The registration system was created using Mongo, Express, Angular, and Node by former ScottyLabs members, which I currently help update and bug fix along with other members on the registration team.</p>

        <p>Sporshmallow is a 2D, two player fighting game in which marshmallow-like characters combat each other. Players can choose between a tennis player (long range) or a karate player (short range). Made in Unity using C# with my friends Gustavo Silvera and Bella Laybourn.</p>

        <p>LUNA</p>
        <p>Luna is a period information web application meant to help women relieve their symptoms. This was a project I worked on during Kode with Klossy with Jevina Wong and Hilary Zen. We only had a day to create it (completely from scratch using HTML, CSS, and Ruby).</p>

        <p>ENVIRONMENTALIST</p>
        <p>EnvironmentaList is an environmental information website. The main page focuses on information about countries' carbon emissions, while other pages give information on how to make a personal positive impact on the environment. This website was made as a part of Kode with Klossy with Daniela Zarate and Danielle Rabiner. It was made in a day using only vanilla HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The technical focus of this project was to learn about responsive design without the use of frameworks.</p>

        <p>TEENHACKS LI</p>
        <p>Teenhacks LI is a hackathon I'm currently helping organize. With the help of my friend, Jeffrey Yu, I made the website that acts as an information page for the hackathon. This website was created using Bootstrap. It was fun learning a CSS framework for the first time!</p>

        <p>SILENT VOICE</p>
        <p>Silent Voice is a s a text-based game intended to bring awareness to the effects of bullying. With the help of my friend, Jeffrey Yu, (again) I made this interactive story through a program called Twine. This project made me truly appreciate the authors that create "choose your own adventure" stories; there were so many different storylines to write!</p>

        <p>TOTORO JUMP</p>
        <p>Totoro Jump is a knock-off of the classic Doodle Jump. This was a project I worked on during my first ever hackathon, CodeDay NY. At the time, I knew little to no code, so I used Construct 2 for this project and followed a beginner tutorial.</p>

        <p>HIGH SCHOOL SURVIVAL GUIDE</p>
        <p>This is a guide I made for people entering Roslyn High School. Though this isn't a coding related project, I wanted to put together a list of all the things I wish I knew before high school. I spent a long time compiling this, and I hope it's useful for someone!</p>
