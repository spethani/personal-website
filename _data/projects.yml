              This was a project I worked on during Kode with Klossy with Jevina Wong and Hilary Zen. 
              We only had a day to create it (completely from scratch using HTML, CSS, and Ruby).

              With the help of my friend, Jeffrey Yu, I made the website that acts as an information page for the hackathon.
              This website was created using Bootstrap. It was fun learning a CSS framework for the first time!

              With the help of my friend, Jeffrey Yu, (again) I made this interactive story through a program called Twine.
              This project made me truly appreciate the authors that create "choose your own adventure" stories; there were so many different storylines to write!

              This was a project I worked on during my first ever hackathon, CodeDay NY.
              At the time, I knew little to no code, so I used Construct 2 for this project and followed a beginner tutorial.

              This was a project I worked on during a competition in code club with my friend Sam Miller.
              This project was the first time I ever used JavaScript.

  description: This is a guide I made for people entering Roslyn High School.
              Though this isn't a coding related project, I wanted to put together a list of all the things I wish I knew before high school.
              I spent a long time compiling this, and I hope it's useful for someone!
