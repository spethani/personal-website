        <p>Hi there, welcome to my website.</p>
        <p>I'm Sarah Pethani, a rising sophomore at Carnegie Mellon (SCS).</p>
        <p>Some of my current passions are computer science and art, which you'll see a bit of on this website.</p>
        <p>Since I made this site completely from scratch, I'd love some feedback!</p>
